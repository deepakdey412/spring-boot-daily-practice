# Day 07 â€“ AuthenticationProvider (Without PasswordEncoder) Practice

---

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did Today
- Implemented **AuthenticationProvider** in Spring Boot for custom authentication logic.
- Created a simple login system **without** using `PasswordEncoder`.
- Connected authentication logic with **Spring Security** flow.
- Used **UserRepo** to fetch user details from the database using `findByUsername`.
- Added logic to compare the plain text password from the request with the stored password in DB.
- Tested API endpoints (`/register` and `/login`) using **Postman**.

---

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
- How `AuthenticationProvider` works in the **Spring Security authentication process**.
- Role of `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` in handling login credentials.
- Difference between **default Spring Security authentication** and **custom authentication**.
- How to manually validate a userâ€™s credentials without encryption.
- Importance of fetching user details using repository methods like `findByUsername`.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Tomorrowâ€™s Plan
- Implement **Password Encryption** using `BCryptPasswordEncoder`.
- Learn and practice how to:
  - Encode passwords before storing in the database.
  - Match raw passwords with encoded passwords during login.
- Update the existing login system to follow **secure authentication** best practices.
