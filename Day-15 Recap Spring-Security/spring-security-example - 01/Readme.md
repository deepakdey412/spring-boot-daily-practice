# Spring Security: Session ID & CSRF Overview

## 1. Session ID
- **What:** A unique identifier assigned to each user session.
- **Created:** When a user logs in, Spring Security creates a session and generates a session ID.
- **Purpose:** Tracks user across multiple requests in the same session.
- **Usage:** Stored in browser cookies and automatically sent with every request.

## 2. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Token
- **What:** A unique token to protect against CSRF attacks.
- **Created:** Generated by Spring Security per session or per form.
- **Purpose:** Ensures that requests (like form submissions) come from the legitimate user.
- **Usage:** Added to HTML forms via Thymeleaf (`<input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="..."/>`).

## 3. MVC Dependency
- Session ID and CSRF token are **automatically managed** in Spring MVC.
- **Non-MVC frontends** (e.g., pure REST APIs, React, Angular) do **not automatically use CSRF tokens**, because there is no server-rendered form.
- For REST APIs, CSRF is often **disabled** and JWT or other stateless auth methods are preferred.

## 4. Key Points
- Session ID → tracks user session.
- CSRF → prevents forged requests.
- MVC → automatic handling.
- Non-MVC (REST) → handle tokens manually or disable CSRF.
