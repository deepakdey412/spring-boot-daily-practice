# 🚀 Day01 - Hello World REST API (Spring Boot)

> 🌟 _"A journey of a thousand lines of code begins with a single Hello World."_  
> Today, I’ve officially started my journey with Spring Boot — and this is my **first ever REST API project**! 🔥

---

## 🧠 What I Built

This project is a simple yet powerful Spring Boot application to understand how REST APIs work. I created **two controllers**, each returning messages on different API endpoints.

## 📦 Dependencies Used

Only one — because we’re keeping it simple and clean:
