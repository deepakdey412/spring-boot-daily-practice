# üöÄ Day 02 - CRUD Operation REST API with Spring Boot

This project is part of my **Spring Boot Daily Practice Series**. On Day 2, I built a simple CRUD REST API using Spring Boot which performs basic operations (Create, Read, Delete) on a `UserModel` entity.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and routes them to the service layer.
- **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic and connects to the repository layer.
- **Model Layer**: Defines the `UserModel` entity.
- **Repository Layer** (Not shown here but assumed): Connects with the database using Spring Data JPA.
