### 📍 Day 3 – Learning Validation in Spring Boot (Today)
- Learned how to use validation annotations like:
  - `@NotBlank`, `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Email`, `@Min`, `@Max`
- Applied validations in:
  - REST APIs (with `@Valid` in controller methods)
  - Thymeleaf forms (showing error messages in UI)
- Customized error messages using `message` attribute
- Practiced both client-side and server-side validation
- Used `BindingResult` to handle validation errors in form submissions
